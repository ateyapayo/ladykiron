                <p>The ascendant in astrology are the means by which we are thrust into a human
                body. The qualities of the zodiac sign in which it falls are indicative of the distinct
                characteristics which define your individual anima, the body through which you
                interact with your surroundings, and thus <b>the mask</b> through which you perceive the
                world and the world perceives you.<br>
                I like to think of its meaning through the analogy of an avatar in a video game or
                through actors within a theatrical play (just as Shakespeare suggested). For
                example, if you are an Aquarius rising, perhaps you are wearing a spacesuit
                costume (this is your animus) and thus the stage (as an analogy for life and the outer
                world) becomes outer space. Likewise, if you are a Scorpio rising, perhaps you are
                wearing a witch’s costume, and thus the stage becomes a dark gloomy forest full of
                unturned stones. However, the catch is that you may have no omniscient awareness
                that you are a character, playing a “role”; that your own perception is creating your
                own reality. The Ascendant and the first house is associated with Aries energy,
                which is instinctual and is the archetype which is characterised as being the spark
                of the fire, the spark of life. Compared to the unconsciousness of the twelfth house
                where we’ve just transitioned from (literally developing within our mother’s wombs) it
                is conscious energy, but without introspection and external observation and input
                (the seventh house) it isn’t necessarily “aware” of itself. <b>Like a stage costume, it is
                the external personality, the outer, surface layer of the ego (the personality) which
                we present to the world.</b> The ascendant instinctually acts, or comes into action, as
                innately as a baby takes its first breath.</p>
                <p>The exact degree of your Ascendant (which changes every four minutes) is a result
                of you being born at a specific time at a specific place and is the moment in which
                universal consciousness (or, “the soul”) manifests itself within the material realm;
                that’s YOU. Birth, and thus the ascendant, is the catalyst for mapping out the
                entirety of the rest of your birth chart, it is the moment in which you decided to play
                the game called life. In this way <b>the Ascendant is an extremely personal and important 
                point</b> in the whole chart, because it is the filter through which the rest of the 
                planets and points in the natal chart must be filtered through. Equally as important then, 
                your chart ruler is the ruling planet of the zodiac sign in which your Ascendant falls in. 
                Analysing the chart ruler then, by sign, house placement and aspects can provide us with further
                insight into the lessons your soul came here to learn when it manifested into your
                body at birth, into the material realm. <b>The chart ruler acts as a gatekeeper to
                unlocking the potential of your whole birth chart</b> in the moment in which it was
                created, and the potential of your life path was mapped. <i>(Note: I say “potential”
                because we all have free will and astrology shouldn’t be fatalistic).</i></p>
