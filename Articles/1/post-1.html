                <h1>Invisible Women - Book review</h1>
                <p>28th December 2021</p>

                <p>I read Perez’s book Invisible Women for a university project, but since it is an important 
                    piece of feminist literature, I thought it deserved a review here too! Overall I thought 
                    Perez’s book provided important insight on issues of equality today through a more scientific, 
                    ther than humanitarian or philosophical, lens. However, I had issues with the way in which 
                    the information throughout the book was presented to the reader.<br>
                    If you are looking for a piece which can provide an encyclopaedia level of information, 
                    this is the book for you, but if you are looking for some deep and thorough reflections 
                    about that information, then you will have to do this yourself. And indeed this is perhaps 
                    what Perez intended the reader to do! However, for the common reader picking up this book 
                    in a book shop out of curiosity the amount of information and evidence presented about 
                    the lack of data collected and considered for women today presents itself as overwhelming. 
                    At times <b>it seemed discouraging to continue reading the book when you knew you were going 
                    to be presented with more of the same</b>, in this way the book lacked a dynamic narrative which 
                    kept you engaged. Albeit, the amount of evidence she presents definitely makes her argument 
                    (that women do not have enough data or information considered about them when structural and 
                    institutional changes are being made; that our world is thus not built for women) seem 
                    water-tight.</p>
                    <p>Exacerbating this flaw is that Perez does not take time to present many 
                    solutions to all the problems she presents to the reader, which again can seem discouraging, 
                    and frankly, depressing. She mentions in the last chapter that her next book will be about 
                    discussing actionable solutions that the reader can take to help solve these issues of 
                    equality, but I believe containing all this information in another book was a 
                    mistake. I doubt that many readers will feel drawn to pick up another book by Perez if they 
                    managed to make it to the end of this one, not because of problems with the content of the 
                    book itself (as I have said, the information she presents is valid and important in taking 
                    another view on issues of equality) but because of the way she presents this. It is for this 
                    reason that I found this book particularly frustrating, because <b>had the information been 
                    packaged in a more readable way, I believe it could do great work in tackling feminism 
                    through science and data!</b> Something which is new and different compared to any feminist 
                    literature I have read before. A few people who have read this book made an interesting 
                    comment that they believe this book is more palatable for male readers, due to the more 
                    hard, factual, and difficult to refute evidence that is presented about the gender 
                    gap. However, I believe stating this, that men are more scientifically minded compared 
                    to women and thus able to tolerate this type of literature much more, only insinuates 
                    further gendered stereotypes which ironically perpetuates the issues of gender inequality 
                    that the book is trying to alleviate.</p>
                    <p>Overall, give this book a go if you want a fresh perspective on modern-day feminism, but 
                    I’d suggest taking sufficient breaks in between each chapter to fully absorb all the 
                    information presented.<br>
                    <b>This book definitely isn’t a page turner!</b></p>
