                <h1>3 Cultural causes of Mistrust against Natural Birth Control</h1>
                <p>1st February 2022</p>
            </div>
            <div class="post">
                <img src="contraceptions.jpg" alt="contraceptions">
                <p>The <b>fertility awareness method</b> can be used as a <b>natural method of contraception</b>, or birth
                control. With perfect use it can be up to <b>99% effective</b> at protecting against pregnancy, which is the
                same as the hormonal contraceptive pill. But if this is true, why do so many people still distrust
                natural birth control as a legitimate means to prevent pregnancy by its users? As a user and advocate
                of the fertility awareness method myself, I will argue that the biggest challenge for marketers in the
                natural contraceptive industry is that they must overcome socio-cultural ideologies which breed
                mistrust of the very product they are trying to sell. Three cultural contributors of consumer mistrust
                that I will discuss are: <i>myths</i> and <i>misinformation</i> around female fertility; menstrual cycles as
                <i>socially taboo</i>; and natural contraception being perceived as <i>anti-feminist.</i></p>
                
                <h2>Myths and Misinformation</h2>
                <p>Up until fairly recently, I too was once a believer in the pervasive myth that women can get
                pregnant any day of their cycle. Brighten (2020) touches on the reasons why this myth persists
                when explaining that school education around fertility is often not legally required to be
                biologically accurate, and that often being taught about our bodies in school is forgone altogether
                <i>(this too was my case)</i>. She also highlights how often abstinence is stressed in school which uses
                <i>fear-inducing misinformation</i> to assert certain ideologies (for example, religiously conservative
                ones). She says, <i>‘if we are taught false information during our formative years by people we
                perceive to be a state of authority and trust, it can be much more difficult to accept the facts when
                they are presented to us later in life’</i> (Brighten, 2020). Scientific knowledge tells us that once a
                woman’s egg(s) dissolves during the twenty-four hour period after she ovulates then pregnancy is
                biologically impossible until during or after her next period (Brighten, 2020, & Weschler, 2016,
                47-48). The pervasiveness of this societal myth, that it is biologically possible that women can get
                pregnant any day of their cycle, is often why many couples who stop using traditional
                contraceptives to conceive are disappointed and confused that they do not get pregnant easily or
                immediately (Robock, 2018). This myth is thus a huge challenge for the natural contraceptive
                industry to overcome because it spreads the misinformation that it is biologically impossible for a
                woman to be naturally infertile (and thus naturally protected from unwanted pregnancies) during
                certain days of her menstrual cycle. This myth would suggest that natural contraception is
                impossible.</p>
                
                <p>This cultural challenge is exacerbated by the misrepresentative and outdated efficacy rates that
                doctors often cite for natural contraceptive methods such as <b>Fertility Awareness</b> (Daley, n.d). Turner
                notes that:<br>
                <i>‘[GP’s] contraceptive resources misleadingly group all fertility-awareness contraceptive
                effectiveness as 76%, corresponding to effectiveness for the Rhythm method. This would be akin to
                assigning <b>“hormonal contraception”</b> (including the Mirena, Implanon and oral contraceptive pills) a
                single effectiveness rate of <b>91%</b> when in fact Mirena is >99%’</i> (2016, 376).<br>
                She goes on to talk about how <b>Billings</b>, a <b>mucus-only FAM</b>, has an efficacy similar to the pill;
                typical use <b>89.5%</b>, <i>perfect use 99%</i>. <b>Sympto-thermal</b> and <b>sympto-hormonal</b> methods have similar
                typical and perfect use rates (Weschler, 2016, 422-23), and all modern efficacies for FAMs are
                based on when the user has learned the method with a certified instructor (Drake, 2021).
                Unfortunately, the spreading of inaccurately low natural contraceptive efficacy rates solidifies the
                cultural myth that natural birth control is biologically impossible and thus further creates the
                message that using a natural method as contraception is an irresponsible choice. <i>I can vouch for this
                stigma first-hand having experienced judgment, criticism and worry from people around me when
                voicing I am an FAM user. There was also a section of my FAM course which gave tips on how to
                deal with inevitable judgement.</i></p>
                
                <p>It is clear to see then how marketers within the natural contraceptive industry are challenged to
                overcome (and effectively dissolve) such socio-cultural beliefs and mistrust towards their products
                in order to sell them. It is thus essentially the marketers’ job to bring to light this misinformation
                and expose it for what is is; to unravel deep-rooted social mythology is no easy feat.</p>
                
                <h2>Menstrual Taboo</h2>
                <p>A second cultural challenge that the natural contraceptive industry will have to overcome is
                that natural menstrual cycles and periods are considered socially taboo and perceived negatively.<br>
                Bobel highlights how ‘acceptable menstrual discourse ... is limited to complaints about <i>cramps</i>,
                jokes about <i>mood swings</i>, and, increasingly, the appeal of continuous oral contraceptives to
                suppress menstruation’ (2010, 44). Grigg-Spall similarly highlights how ‘our cultural view of
                menstruation has acted as a catalyst for our eager uptake of hormonal contraceptives. We have been
                told for decades that periods are <i>unfeminine</i>, unattractive and gross and that having a period is
                <b>shameful</b> and <b>unbearable</b>’ (2013, 65). What both authors highlight here is that there is no social
                value for the fluctuations of the natural menstrual cycle due to deep-rooted patriarchal ideologies
                
                within Western cultures. Patriarchal values also intersect with and are exacerbated by capitalistic
                ideologies. Kissling discusses this with reference to the postfeminist, neoliberal subject who is
                controlled, predictable, and ready for work at all times. She notes how it is these type of women that
                are most used in US TV commercials for oral contraceptive pills which were advertised as lifestyle
                drugs by reinforcing these negative attitudes towards the <i>“chaotic”</i> or <i>“unpredictable”</i> menstrual
                
                cycle in their marketing messaging (2013, 490-504). The ideal member of this patriarchal-
                capitalistic structured society then seems to have the non-cyclical biology of a male.</p>
                
                <p>The reason why these negative cultural beliefs surrounding female fertility pose a challenge for the
                natural contraceptive industry is because natural contraception does not suppress this, but rather
                embraces it. Just like how marketers within the traditional contraceptive industry capitalised on
                negative cultural attitudes towards female fertility to sell their products, marketers for natural
                contraception will have to capitalise on more niche social movements which promote positive
                attitudes towards this. Movements such as period positivity or radical menstruators re-frame female
                fertility and menstruation in a positive light to counter traditional patriarchal and capitalistic cultural
                ideologies.</p>
                
                <h2>Politicisation of Contraceptive Choice</h2>
                <p class="img-left-post"><img src="bw-feminist.jpg" alt="feminist">The politicisation of contraceptive choice is also a <b>socio-political challenge</b> to this industry.
                During 1950-70 feminists fought and protested for more reproductive freedom for women; they
                fought for the pill (Watkins, 1998). Grigg-Spall highlights how their feminist politics were centred
                
                around the <i>“biology is not destiny”</i> argument, and that this politicisation of the pill means that non-
                pill taking women now are <i>‘treated as difficult and irresponsible, ... they are ungrateful of the work
                
                of women in history and of the privilege afforded them’</i> (2013, 71). The rise of cancel culture and
                this moral judgement upon non-pill taking women creates an obstacle for the natural birth control
                industry because consumers are reluctant to buy their product due to fear of exclusion. There is thus
                an opportunity here for marketers to make female consumers realise that choosing natural
                contraception is not anti-feminist, but rather approaches feminism via a different route. Martin
                offers ways of thinking to escape from the “biology is not destiny” bind. She argues that we need to
                start listening to and considering women’s fluctuating experiences throughout their cycle, and rather
                than seeing these natural differences to men as the problem to be fixed or suppressed, to see the
                society that requires this to be the problem which needs to be addressed (Martin, 1987, as cited by
                Grigg-Spall, 2013, 70).</p>
                
                <p>Using thorough data and evidence, Perez similarly shows how <b>society</b> and
                
                its infra-structure <b>has not been built for or by women</b>; that by ignoring biological differences we are
                not necessarily achieving more equality, because equality is achieved when we do not discriminate
                women for their natural differences (2019). Bobel also re-considers whether a woman’s choice to
                suppress her menstrual cycle with oral contraceptives comes from a place of true, autonomous
                liberation when the reasons for doing so may be rooted in inherently patriarchal ideologies and
                misinformation (2010) such as those previously discussed. Personally, my decision to use natural
                contraception was solidified when realising the lack of logic behind women taking medication that
                affects their physiology 24/7 <i>(and has side effects)</i> when women are cyclically fertile for 24 hours
                but men are fertile 24/7 (Weschler, 2016, 12, 35). I believe that drawing consumers’ attention
                towards these issues, questions and injustices would help to dissolve this socio-cultural belief and
                thus the problem marketers in this industry face.</p>
                
                <p>These socio-cultural elements of misinformation and lack of education, menstrual taboo and the
                politicisation of contraceptive choice are what ultimately create consumer mistrust for natural
                contraceptives. This means that building a new foundation of trust in consumers in this industry is
                the main challenge for marketing natural birth control.</p>
